# Comparing Multilayer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines Models for Classifying Dry Beans

The project inolved optimisin the performanc of two types of supervised learning algorithms on a popular tabular dataset of dry beans. The algorithms in question are multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and support vector machines (SVM). A process of hyperparameter tuning and architecture experimentation was undertaken for both apporaches. The SVM proves to be more accurate,but the MLP model performs better at batch inference tasks.

Popular Python libaries PyTorch, Sci-Kit Learn, and Skorch, were used to optimise and train classification models.
